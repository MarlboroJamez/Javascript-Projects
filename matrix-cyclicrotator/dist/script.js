//QUESTION (100% TOTAL)

//An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element //of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right //by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).

//The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.

//Write a function:

//function solution(A, K);

//that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.

//For example, given

    //A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
    //K = 3
//the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:

    //[3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    //[6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
    //[7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
//For another example, given

    //A = [0, 0, 0]
    //K = 1
//the function should return [0, 0, 0]

//Given

    //A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    //K = 4
//the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]

//Assume that:
//N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
//each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
